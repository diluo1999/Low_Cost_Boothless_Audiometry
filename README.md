# Low Cost Boothless Audiometry

## Description

Boothless audiometry is a technology that promises to increase access to hearing examinations in low-income regions. However, there is a need for the technology to be cheaper, more informative, reliable, and easy-to-use to aid audiologists in making more accurate and informed hearing loss diagnoses.

See [Written Proposal](Written%20Proposal.pdf) and [Proposal Presentation](Proposal%20Oral%20Presentation.pdf) for detailed description of the project.
